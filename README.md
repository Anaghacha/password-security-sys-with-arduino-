# Password Security System with Arduino

This repository contains the code and documentation for a password-based security system using Arduino. The system enhances home security by using a keypad, LCD, and other components to detect intruders and send alerts.

## Description

The project aims to design a cost-efficient wireless communication link to monitor home security and provide easy access without compromising safety.

## Components

- Arduino Uno R3 Board
- Keypad
- LCD
- Buzzer
- Servo Motor
- Bluetooth Module

## Features

- Sends an alert on entering the wrong password.
- Confirmation message and door operation on correct password entry.
- Displays door status on the LCD screen.
- Moves the servo motor to simulate door opening/closing.

## Methodology

1. Entering a wrong password triggers an alert and activates the buzzer.
2. Correct password entry sends a confirmation message and moves the servo motor.
3. Displays door status on the LCD.
4. Alerts are sent via Bluetooth.

## Usage

Upload the code to the Arduino board and connect the components as per the circuit diagram. Use the keypad to interact with the system.
