# password-security-sys-with-arduino-
_**Introduction**_
Science and technology have advanced our life in many ways. It facilitates the process of industrialization as well as modernization of the world. It has blessed us with many sophisticated devices by facilitating our life. Password based security system is one of the modern electronic lock systemWe have designed an interesting and cheap home security system. This Gadget helps you to protect your house from thieves. In this project we are going to use an Arduino Uno R3 Board, keypad, LCD and some other components. This Project can be powered with U.S.B of your computer. When an intruder is detected, it activates a siren and. 
_**Motivation**_
The need for home security alarm systems nowadays is a serious demand. As the number of crimes are increasing every day, there has to be something that will keep us safe. 
The concept of home automation and its safety has been around since late 1970s. But during the course of time with the advancement of technology, our expectation from home has changed a lot and so have the idea of home automation and its security systems. If we look at different home automation systems over time, they have always tried to provide efficient, convenient and safe ways for home inhabitants to access their homes.

_**Problem statement**___
Humans have invented locks since ancient times, to use them to protect their privacy and personal belongings. they are constantly evolving over the ages for better protection. But the problem is that locking the door these days is not safe and can be easily bypassed. Our doors can be forgotten, and this is a common occurrence for most people. Locks are trying these days to depends on technology by using a code or phone or by card to make our things safer. But there are limits, which are the lack of features to be combined in one place. also, the lack of high-security features. To solve this problem, we need to combine all the modern security features into one lock as well as monitoring features. Thus, we have high security, comfortable opening, and closing systems, and features that help us easier and faster, all requirements do not conflict and help to make our homes safer than before.
_**Objective**__
The objective of this project is to design a cost -efficient  wireless communication link to monitor our home and to provide an easy access without compromising security.
_**Methodology**_
●	On entering the wrong password through a 4*3 keypad, it will send us an alert on the phone also the buzzer starts beeping.
●	On entering the right password, it will send us a confirmation message that the door has opened. 
●	Door opening and closing message will get displayed on the I2c LCD screen 
●	Also the servo motor which represents door in our project would start moving whenever we enter a correct password.
●	The alert message would be sent to the phone through the bluetooth device.
